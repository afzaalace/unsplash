# Unsplash Image Downloader

An Unsplash auto-downloader and sync tool for node.js.

## Introduction

Hacker's way of grabbing all of the images at Unsplash.com quickly, easily, and for free.

## Install

Install this package globally via NPM by running the following command:

```shell
npm install -g unsplash
```

You now have access to the `unsplash` command.

## Usage

```shell
unsplash [options] <folder>
```

The `unsplash` command accepts two options and a path to directory:

* -h, --help		|| output usage information .
* -f, --featured 	|| download only featured images.
* [folder] defaults to current directory

### To save images to your current folder

Navigate to the path that you want to save the files in and execute the `unsplash` command with the --featured options if you want only featured images. Here is an example:

```shell
unsplash -f
```

This will tell the program to save featured images to your current working directory. It will not download or overwrite any existing files.

### To save images to a specific folder

Same as above but specify the path to the save directory from your current working directory as the third argument. For example:

```shell
unsplash wallpapers/
```

This will tell the program to save all images to the wallpapers directory. It will not download or overwrite any existing files.

### Cache

The scraped image URLs are saved in a json file `images.json` inside the same folder. This is to avoiding rescraping if the process fails. To force a rescrape delete the file before running unsplash.

### Use as a Node.js module.
Unsplash is also available as a Node.js module.

```
var unsplash = require('unsplash');
unsplash(<string:path>,[boolean: onlyfeatured])
```
